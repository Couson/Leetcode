# Runtime Screenshots

This section doesn't make sense at all. Leetcode's runtime depends on the Wi-Fi
bandwidth and many other random factors. Yet, I still include them here simply for
fun. 

Isn't it enjoyable when seeing your algorithm beats 100% other submissions? 

Feel like king in the world.
