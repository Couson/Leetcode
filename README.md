# Leetcode Questions

## Introduction

This repository contains my on-going summary of classical Leetcode questions.

It aims to help me prepare for coding interview, but more importantly, it serves as the playground where
I improve my software engineering's fundamental skills. 

I believe Leetcode is not simply about coding a solution, but about ***problem solving***, 
*mathematical analysis* and *coding habits tuning*.

This repository is online at https://leetcode.li-mao.net, powered by gitbook.
