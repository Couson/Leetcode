# Leetcode Questions

This repository contains my on-going summary of classical Leetcode questions. It's organized into 
different categories as following:

- Basic Data Structures
- Linear Structure
- Tree
- Graph
- Dynamic Programming
- Mathematics

It aims to help me prepare for coding interview, but more importantly, it serves as the playground where
I improve my software engineering's fundamental skills. 

I believe Leetcode is not simply about coding a solution, but about ***problem solving***, 
*mathematical analysis* and *coding habits tuning*.
