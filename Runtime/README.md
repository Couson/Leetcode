# Runtime Screenshots

This section includes all runtime screenshots of my solution (or my replicated version of others' solutions). Currently it's not visible from Gitbook. You can checkout my Github repository [here](https://github.com/maoli131/Leetcode). 

This section doesn't make sense at all. Leetcode's runtime depends on many random factors such as server load. Yet, I still include them here simply for fun. Isn't it enjoyable when seeing your algorithm beats 100% other submissions? 

Feel like king in the world.
